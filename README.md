# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implementation

## Overview

This project presents an implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The primary goal is to demonstrate how RNNs can be used for sequence modeling tasks, such as text generation, time series prediction, and other applications involving sequential data.

The notebook provides a clear and concise walkthrough of building, compiling, training, and evaluating a simple RNN model.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for sequential modeling
- Construction of an RNN model using Keras Sequential API
- Model compilation with appropriate loss function and optimizer
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of model performance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure

- `RNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete RNN implementation, from data preparation to model evaluation and visualization.
